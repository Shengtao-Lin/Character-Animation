I do not have the link for the game to play online but there is a html file in the RollABallWebGL folder that can run the game.

The game has 2 players and 15 pickup objects. The Player 1 uses WASD to control the direction of the ball and X to jump. The Player2 uses IJKL to control the ball and M to jump. 
When player pick up pickup objects, they will receive one point and when they lose a collision or hit the wall they will lose one point. When 120s time limit pass or all 15 objects has been picked up the game will end.

The game will announce when ther is a collision (with player or with wall) happened and when time is only 20s left.
